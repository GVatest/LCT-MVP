## About

- API was developed based on `django rest framework` using `sqlite3` database, as it is an mvp project, working with `sqlite3` was easier and faster than its more advanced alternatives such as `postgresql`.
- Authorization is implemented based on `JWT` tokens
- The frontend is implemented using the `React` library in conjunction with the `Redux` state manager
- Loading and processing of `Dicom` slices on the front end is done using the open-source library `[DWV] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dwv)`
- The functionality of the annotator is based on the functionality of the library for working with computer vision algorithms `[OpenCV.js] (https://docs.opencv.org/4.6.0/d5/d10/tutorial_js_root.html)`

## _Additional_

I was one of the participants of the `FutureOfMedTech` team at the `LCT 2022` hackathon, serving as a `full-stack` developer. I took on responsibilities for writing the API and implementing the database, as well as actively participating in the development of the application's frontend. I set up authentication with `JWT` tokens, implemented access to data from another account via a link, and handled the loading, initial processing, and display of `Dicom` slices. I also contributed to the development of the annotation functionality, including importing and exporting annotations in `JSON`, loading multiple images, scrolling images, and providing annotation tools. Additionally, I took on the responsibility of merging three modules of the application: the pathology generation module, the Dicom image annotator and the studies and employee management system. The final challenge was deploying and configuring the application on a remote server, using the `nginx` + `gunicorn`.
